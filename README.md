  ### Introduction
This project explores a data-driven analysis of Pixar films using advanced SQL techniques. The goal is to uncover insights into film performance, production trends, and audience reception by querying and analyzing structured datasets related to Pixar's movie catalog.

To perform this analysis, I utilized several key SQL features:
- Window Functions to calculate running totals, rankings, and moving averages across films.
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries and break down analysis into logical steps.
- Subqueries to filter and compare data within nested contexts.
- Joins to combine information from multiple related tables, such as film details, box office data, and critic scores.

This combination of techniques enabled a comprehensive look at Pixar‚Äôs production history, including trends in film ratings, release patterns, and commercial success.

  ### Dataset Overview
  The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about Pixar‚Äôs feature films, spanning multiple aspects of production, performance, and reception. It is structured into several interrelated tables to support in-depth SQL analysis.

üóÇÔ∏è Key Tables & Fields:
1. pixar_films:
    - film_id (Primary Key).
    - film
    - title.
    - release_date.
    - run_time.
    - film_rating.
    - rating.
    
2. Public response.

3. Pixar_people:
    - film (Foreign key).
    - role_type.
    - name.
    
4. Genres.

5. box_office:
    - film(foreign key).
    - budget.
    - box_office_us_canada: amount generate in us and canada.
    - box_office_other: amount generate in other region.
    - box_office_worldwide: amount generate in box_office_us_canada + amount generate in box_office_other.
    
6. academy:
    - film(foreign key).
    - award_type: the nature of the award given.
    - status: current status.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

To prepare the Pixar dataset for analysis, the following data cleaning and transformation steps were performed:

1. Standardized Date Formats

    - Converted release_date fields to consistent DATE format for accurate sorting and filtering.

2. Trimmed and Cleaned Text Fields

    - Removed extra spaces and standardized capitalization for film titles, genres, and names (e.g., "Toy story " ‚Üí "Toy Story").

3. Handled Missing Values

    - Replaced or flagged nulls in key fields like box_offices and public_response.

    - Excluded records with critical missing data (e.g., film name or release date).

4. Unified Data Types

    - Ensured numerical fields (like budget, box_offices, and run_time) were cast to proper numeric types for calculations.
    
5. Created Derived Columns

    - Added calculated fields like profit (box_office_worldwide - budget) and year (extracted from release_date).

6. Resolved Duplicates and Inconsistencies

    - Deduplicated film records across tables using film name and release date as unique keys.
